This Julia package facilitates the statistical assessment of the variability of editing rates of transcripts across
different cells. The package has resulted from the joint research of Theodore Papamarkou, Chris Oates, Anastasia
Papavasiliou, University of Warwick, UK, and Dewi Harjanto, Nina Papavasiliou, Rockefeller University, USA, on the
differentiation of editing rates of APOBEC1-related sites across cells.

To install the package, call

```
Pkg.clone("git@github.com:scidom/CellwiseEditingDifferentiation.jl.git")
```
